Bootstrap   - 5.3.3

Python packages:

Python3 version - 3.11.4 as of development
Django      - 5.0.6

Setting Up the Project Steps:
1. Create a folder with any name, which will contain:
    - venvcrm
    - clientflow (this folder)
    Do not create empty folders with these names
2. In Command Prompt, go to the directory of your folder, and type 'python -m venv venvcrm' without the quotations
3. Run the virtual environment by typing this (considering you are in Windows): venvcrm\Scripts\activate
4. Once venv is running, type the command: pip install django
5. If there are other required packages, install them as well. If a `requirements.txt` file is present, use: pip install -r requirements.txt
6. You are now set up

Commands (considering the venv is running):
- To run the server, run this command:
    python manage.py runserver 
- Create superuser:
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    Follow the prompts to set your own username, email, and password.
- Make migrations
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
